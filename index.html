        <h2> Mugiwara!</h2>
      <p>    Usually when he asks someone to join, Luffy is turned down completely;
   though the way of which he is turned down varies. Luffy never forces people to join his crew against their will. When Luffy asked
   Brook during the Thriller Bark Arc, Brook said yes immediately. Luffy did not directly ask Usopp to join the Straw Hats, however
   when Luffy, Zoro and Nami were about to sail off, Luffy assumed that Usopp would join them as they had just fought off Kuro.

            <h2>Kaizoku Ou ni,ore wa naru!</h2>
            <P>
                While Kaido may have held the rather infamous title of "Emperor of the Sea," the World Government actually gave 
        him Monkey D. Luffy. Theof action. Chapter #1055 provided crucial context for that, while also showing where the future
      is headed for Monkey D. Luffy. The World Government thought coming after Kaido would have required an enormous outlay
     of funds. Being in command of one of the strongest forces in the world, engaging Kaido and the Beast Pirates in battle would
      require significant forces and the losses would be significant, regardless of the winner. Lastly, and perhaps most importantly,
       as Admiral Ryokugyu (Green Bull) reveals, Kaido's actions meant that he wanted to keep Wano Country closed to the outside world,
        which was exactly what the World Government wanted.
